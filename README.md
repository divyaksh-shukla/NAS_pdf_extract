# NAS (_National Achievement Survey_) pdf extract
This is a library written in python to exctract data from the NAS (National Achivement Survey) pdf files and tablue them in a csv for analysis. (It works only on a linux machine) Python3

```bash
$ python3 pdf_convert.py
```
Followed by 
```bash
$ python3 pdf_extract_2.py
```
`pdf_extract.py` is my first version that did not take the names of the states perfectly, `pdf_extract_2.py` is an improvement over the prior to take all the data perfectly.
